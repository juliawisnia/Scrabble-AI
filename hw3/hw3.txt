PROBLEM 2
(a):
enqueue(1) stack1: 1 is on the top
			stack2: empty

enqueue(2): stack 1: contains 1, 2, top is 2
			stack2: empty

dequeue(): stack 1: empty
			stack2: contains 2, 1, top is 1

enqueue(3): stack 1: 3 is on top
			stack2: contains 2, 1, top is 1

enqueue(4): stack1: contains 3, 4, top is 4
			stack2: contains 2, 1, top is 1

dequeue(): stack 1: contains 3, 4, top is 4
			stack2: 2 is on the top

enqueue(5): stack1: contains 3, 4, 5, top is 5
			stack2: 2 is on the top

enqueue(6): stack1: contains 3, 4, 5, 6, top is 6
			stack2: 2 is on the top
(b): enqueue(x) takes theta(1) time, because you are
		adding to the front of the list
		dequeue(x) takes theta(n) time, because you have to
		pop n items, then push n items, which would be 2n,
		so it becomes theta(n).
(c): enqueue(x) still takes theta(1) time, but dequeue(x)
		takes theta(n^2) time, because to pop n elements when
		pop() takes theta(n) would be n^2 time, then to push
		would also be n^2 time, and n^2+n^2 becomes theta(n^2).

Problem 1: AVL Trees (hand-drawn)
My answer to this problem can be found in the
file hw7q1.pdf.

Problem 2: BinarySearchTrees
This is implemented in bst.h.

Problem 3: The Power of Rotations
This is implemented in rotateBST.h.

Problem 4: AVL Trees 
This is implemented in avlbst.h.
My heights are implemented to start at 1, because
my code works on rotations by getting the max child's
height, and an empty tree has a height 0. Thus each leaf
node would have a height 1.
